# Job Runtime Trend Dashboard## Overview
This Power BI dashboard is created to understand how job runtimes change over time.
It helps identify which months have higher or lower runtimes and observe overall yearly trends.

## Purpose
- Track job runtime changes across months
- Identify peak and low runtime periods
- Support performance monitoring and analysis

## Data Used
The dashboard was initially built using **dummy (sample) data** to design and validate visuals.
Dummy data follows the same structure as actual runtime data.

When replaced with **actual data**:
- The dashboard works without any changes
- Similar insights and trends are produced
- Visuals continue to show accurate results

## Tool Used
- **Power BI** for data modeling and visualization

## Outcome
This dashboard provides a clear view of runtime trends over the year and can be reused with real data to support monitoring and decision‑making.
